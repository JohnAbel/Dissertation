While light may be applied or removed instantaneously, pharmaceutical perturbation of the clock is constrained by pharmacokinetics.
To alleviate numerical complications arising due to unidentified (and likely nonlinear) pharmacokinetics, we selected a piecewise-constant parameterization of the control:
\begin{equation}
u(t) = u(t_k) \; \forall \; t_k \leq t < t_{k+1},
\end{equation}
and denote the sampling time $t_{k+1}-t_k$ as $\tau_u$.
For a predictive horizon of $N_p$ steps of duration $\tau_u$, we define
\begin{eqnarray}
U&\triangleq& \begin{bmatrix}
u(t_k) & u(t_k+\tau_u) & \cdots & u\left(t_k+(N_p-1)\tau_u\right)
\end{bmatrix}^\top
\end{eqnarray}
as the knots of the control trajectory defined at each of the $N_p$ steps.
To estimate the phase at the end of each step the phase dynamics in \eqref{eq:cphase} may be integrated over each of the $\ell \in \begin{bmatrix}1 & \cdots & N_p\end{bmatrix}$  steps to yield:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:discretephase}
    \hat\phi(t_i+\ell\tau_u) = \phi(t_i) + \frac{2\pi\ell\tau_u}{\tau}-\sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1} \int_{t_{k+i}}^{t_{k+1+i}} u(t_k)\frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\phi}{d(vdCn)}\Bigr|_{\mathbf{x}^\gamma}\, dt,
\end{equation}
where $\hat \phi$ is the predicted phase, $t_i$ is the current time, $\phi(t_i)$ is measured, and the PRC is a function of $\hat{\phi}$.
We define the phase error to be the magnitude of the phase difference between the predicted phase and the environmental phase:
\begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:phierror}
    \begin{eqnarray}
        e_\phi(\cdot) &\triangleq& \left|\angle\left(\exp(\j\hat\phi(\cdot)-\j\phi_e(\cdot))\right)\right|,
    \end{eqnarray}
    where $\j=\sqrt{-1}$. Computationally, driving phase error to $0$ is numerically unstable, so we relax the terminal constraint by ignoring phase error below a constant $\delta_\phi$:
    \begin{eqnarray}
    g_{\phi}(\cdot) & \triangleq &
        \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{if}\ e_\phi(\cdot)<\delta_\phi\\
            e_\phi(\cdot) & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
so that numerical imprecisions do not result in controller action.
Thus, the finite-horizon optimal control problem at each time $t_j$ may be solved for the optimal trajectory $u^\star$:
\begin{eqnarray}
        \nonumber \qquad u^\star &=& \arg\min_{U} \;\sum_{\ell=1}^{N_p} w^\phi_{\ell}g^2_{\phi}(t_i+\ell\tau_u) + w^u_{\ell-1}u^2(t_i+(\ell-1)\tau_u)\\
        \nonumber \text{subject to:}&&\\
        \label{eq:mpcoptim}   \hat\phi(t_i+\ell\tau_u) &=& \phi(t_i) + \frac{2\pi\ell\tau_u}{\tau}-\sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1} \int_{t_{k+i}}^{t_{k+1+i}}u(t_k)\frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\phi}{d(vdCn)}\Bigr|_{\mathbf{x}^\gamma}\, dt,\\
     \nonumber  0 &\le& u_{\ell-1}\le \bar u, 
    \end{eqnarray}
for all $\ell=1, \cdots,N_p$, where $w^\phi_{\ell}$ and $w^u_{\ell-1}$ are positive weighting scalars evaluated at the end of the time step and start of the time step, respectively, as phase error is calculated after the control is applied for that step.
After identifying the optimal piecewise control trajectory $u^\star$, we applied $u^\star(t_i)$ to the full 8-state ODE model for $t \in (t_i, t_i+\tau_u]$ as is standard in model predictive control.

For this MPC formulation, $w^\phi$, $w^u$, $N_p$, and $\tau_u$ are design parameters which may vary.
We have selected:
\begin{align*}
w^\phi_{\ell} &= \ell,\\
w^u_{\ell-1} & = 1,
\end{align*}
for $ \ell=1,\cdots, N_p$.
We have elsewhere investigated optimal selection of design variables $N_p$ and $\tau_u$ for this exact formulation of MPC \cite{Abel2017a}. 
Based on these findings, we set $N_p=3$ (and $N_u=N_p$ where $N_u$ is the number of length of the control horizon) and $\tau_u=2$h, and instead studied the how phase control of a single oscillator differs from an oscillator population.


\subsection{Case Study \#1: Nonlinear MPC for a Single Oscillator\label{ssec:applysc}}

To demonstrate the behavior of this controller, we applied it for the phase shifting control problem where a phase delay of 6h occurs at 12h (a phase delay of $\pi/4$ at a phase of $\pi$).
The environmental phase for this example was given by \ref{eq:ephase}, where $\Delta \phi=-\pi/2$, and $t_{shift} =12$h.
We used the Python language to solve the MPC problem, specifically, we used CasADi \cite{Andersson2012} and SciPy for formulation, and PySwarm to solve the nonlinear programming optimization problem.
Here, the numerical error in calculating phase was $\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ and so design variable $\delta_\phi = 0.1$.

The results of this simulation are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fig2}.
Briefly, the controller began its action at $t=12$h to achieve a phase delay.
The full $6$h phase delay could not be achieved within the initial negative region, and so the remainder of the shift was accomplished when the PRC returned to a negative value near 30h.
A decrease in amplitude occurred near $t=30$h due to transient deviation from the limit cycle, and the full amplitude returned for the following peak.


\section{Control of Population Phase and Synchrony}

The circadian oscillator is cell-autonomous, and each tissue is comprised of many thousands of individual oscillators.
While the SCN master pacemaker maintains its synchrony through intercellular communication, other tissues such as the liver lack paracrine signaling and are kept synchronized through a variety of identified and as-yet unidentified means, as guided by the SCN \cite{Welsh2010}.
The application of a pharmaceutical to any of these populations will affect this synchrony, and thus the amplitude of oscillation \cite{Ukai2007,StJohn2014b}.

While transient deviations from the limit-cycle eventually return to the limit-cycle amplitude, reduction in amplitude due to desynchrony will persist in the absence of signaling, making populations with weak coupling susceptible to long-term desynchrony from mistimed control.
The change in synchrony in response to perturbation may be calculated from the PRC \cite{StJohn2014b}.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}C we show how this may be intuitively understood based on the slope of the PRC: oscillator populations that lie on regions of positive slope result in the cells which are ahead in phase advancing further (or being delayed less) than oscillators which lag to begin with, broadening the probability density function (PDF) of phase.
Inversely, populations lying on a region of negative slope are condensed in phase by a similar argument.

Here, we first apply the previously-described controller to a population of uncoupled oscillators to demonstrate the deleterious effect of a population-agnostic nonlinear MPC on synchrony.
We then modify the MPC controller to explicitly penalize population desynchronization and demonstrate the ability to simultaneously control phase and synchrony of a population.

\subsection{Case Study \#2: Limitation of Single-Oscillator Assumption\label{ssec:scpop}}

We first applied the controller from Sec.~\ref{ssec:controller} to a population of oscillators, with slight modification for tracking the mean phase of the population.
We modified the predictor in \eqref{eq:discretephase} to use the mean phase of the population $\bar{\phi}$ rather than the phase of an individual oscillator:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:poppredictor}
    \hat\phi(t_i+\ell\tau_u) = \bar{\phi}(t_i) + \frac{2\pi\ell\tau_u}{\tau}-\sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1} \int_{t_{k+i}}^{t_{k+1+i}} u(t_k)\frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\phi}{d(vdCn)}\Bigr|_{\mathbf{x}^\gamma}\, dt.
\end{equation}
Here, we calculated $\bar{\phi}(t_i)$ from the phases of each oscillator $\phi_n$ in the population by the parameter $z\in\mathbb C$ describing the population:
\begin{equation}
    z = \rho\,\exp(\mathrm{i}\bar{\phi}) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\exp(\j\phi_n),
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the Kuramoto order parameter, or colloquially, the synchrony index.
We emphasize that the controller did not observe any information about the population aside from its mean phase, and as such, the predictor \eqref{eq:discretephase} used in the finite horizon optimal control problem was imprecise due to slight differences between single-cell and population-mean phase response \cite{StJohn2014b}.
The controller was otherwise parameterized identically to that in Sec.~\ref{ssec:controller}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:fig3} shows the result of applying this controller to a population of 200 identical uncoupled oscillators with initial phases sampled from the PDF:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wnbsol}
    p(\phi) = f_{WN}(\phi; \phi_0, \sigma),
\end{equation}
where $f_{WN}$ indicates a wrapped normal distribution with mean $\phi_0$ (set to $0$, to match the mean with the single oscillator case), and standard deviation $\sigma$ (set to $\pi/12$, approximately capturing the distribution of phases observed) \cite{StJohn2014b}.
As in the single-cell case, control was applied immediately starting at $t=12$h to begin correcting for the $6$h phase delay.
In the population case, this corresponds to a region of positive slope of the PRC, and intuitively resulted in a desynchronization of phase as evidenced by the decline in synchrony index for the duration of the KL001 pulse.
Despite the amplitudes of the individual oscillators (gray) returning after a transient to their pre-pulse levels, the population mean [PER] amplitude was reduced by approximately one-third due to desynchronization of the population.
Because there was no intercellular or external communication driving synchrony, the amplitude of the mean remained diminished for the duration of the simulation.

\subsection{Population MPC Algorithm for Phase Coherence \label{ssec:popmpc}}
A more sophisticated approach to control of an oscillator population involves predicting the evolution of the PDF itself rather than only mean phase.
Methods have been developed previously to compute the change in PDF directly in response to stimulation \cite{StJohn2014b}.
A change in variables allows the numerical computation of the new phase PDF:
\begin{equation}
    \hat p(\phi, t)dh(\phi) = p(\phi, t)d\phi,
\end{equation}
where $\hat p(\phi, t)$ is the predicted PDF at time $t$ for phases $\phi$, and $h(\phi) = \phi + \Delta\phi$, called the phase transition curve (PTC), is the total response to perturbation.
We may therefore revise the prediction model to explicitly involve calculation of the phase PDF at each step of the predictive horizon.
The PTC for each step within the predictive horizon may be calculated in a similar fashion to the predictor for the single-oscillator case:
\begin{equation}
    h_k(\phi) = \phi+ \frac{2\pi\tau_u}{\tau} -u(t_k) \int_{t_{k}}^{t_{k+1}}\frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\phi}{d(vdCn)}\Bigr|_{\mathbf{x}^\gamma}\, dt,
\end{equation}
where $u$ is piecewise-constant and the integrand is a function of $\phi$ which may be calculated numerically in advance as previously defined.
This function may be calculated numerically for each step, and used to calculate the evolution of the PDF:
\begin{equation}
    \hat p(\phi, t_{k+1})dh_k(\phi) = \hat p(\phi, t_k)d\phi.
\end{equation}
To calculate the first step, $\hat p(\phi, t) = p(\phi, t)$ is measured from the population under control.
The population predicted mean phase $\hat \phi$ and synchrony index $\hat \rho$ may then be calculated from the predicted PDF:
\begin{equation}
    \hat\rho(t_k)\exp(\j\hat\phi(t_k)) = \int_0^{2\pi} \hat p(\theta,t_k)\exp(\j\theta)d\theta,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is a dummy variable of phase. 
The phase error term $g_\phi$ may remain as defined in \eqref{eq:phierror}, and we define a similar error term penalizing desynchrony
   \begin{eqnarray}
    g_{\rho}(\cdot) & \triangleq &
        \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{if}\ \rho>\delta_\rho\\
            (1-\rho(\cdot)) & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{eqnarray}
which reduces to 0 for a satisfactorily synchronized population.


Thus, the population control problem is:
\begin{eqnarray}
        \nonumber \qquad u^\star &=& \arg\min_{U} \;\mathcal J\\
        \nonumber \text{subject to:}&&\\       
        \nonumber \mathcal J &=& \sum_{\ell=1}^{N_p} w^\phi_{\ell}g^2_{\phi}(t_i+\ell\tau_u)+ w^\rho_{\ell}g^2_\rho(t_i+\ell\tau_u) + w^u_{\ell-1}u^2(t_i+(\ell-1)\tau_u),\\
        \nonumber  h_k(\phi) &=& \frac{2\pi\tau_u}{\tau} -u(t_k) \int_{t_{k}}^{t_{k+1}}\frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\phi}{d(vdCn)}\Bigr|_{\mathbf{x}^\gamma}\, dt,\\
        \label{eq:mpcPDFoptim} \hat p(\phi, t_{k+1})dh_k(\phi) &=& \hat p(\phi, t_k)d\phi\\
        \nonumber \hat\rho(t_k)\exp(\j\hat\phi(t_k)) &=& \int_0^{2\pi} \hat p(\theta,t_k)\exp(\j\theta)d\theta\\
     \nonumber  0 &\le& u_{\ell-1}\le \bar u, 
\end{eqnarray}
where phase error and synchrony are calculated at the end of each step within the predictive horizon.





\subsection{Case Study \#3: Implementation of Population Nonlinear MPC Controller\label{ssec:popapply}}
As before, $w^{\phi}$, $w^u$, $w^\rho$, $N_p$ and $\tau_u$ are design parameters.
These parameters were set as in Sec.~\ref{ssec:controller}, with the exception of the new weighting of synchrony:
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber w^\rho = 10(\ell+1),
\end{equation}
which was set such that the synchrony term is of the same order of magnitude as the phase term, and increases to allow flexibility of synchrony early in the horizon.
Tuning this parameter will adjust the sensitivity of the controller to temporary desynchrony.
As $w^\rho \to \infty$, the controller will take no action unless it results in no loss of synchrony, i.e., the population lies completely on a region of negative slope of the PRC.
For lower but nonzero $w^\rho$, as in the case here, some flexibility is permitted, in that the controller may apply action that desynchronizes the population if it results in a large reduction in phase error.
Correspondingly, the controller will later resynchronize the population to account for this early desynchrony.
For $w^\rho=0$, the controller will behave as the popualtion-agnostic case.
After calculating the finite horizon optimal control $u^\star$, we apply the first step $u^\star(t_j)$ to all oscillators within the population for $t\in [t_j,t_j+\tau_u)$, and repeat this process.

    We applied the controller described in Sec.~\ref{ssec:popmpc} to the same phase shifting problem as the previous controllers: $t_{shift}=12$h, $\Delta\phi = -6$h.
The initial phase of the 200 uncoupled oscillators comprising the population was sampled from the PDF:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:convdiffsol}
    p(\phi) = f_{WN}(\phi; \phi_0, \sigma),
\end{equation}
where $f_{WN}$ indicates a wrapped normal distribution with mean $\phi_0 = 0$ and standard deviation $\sigma=\pi/12$.

Results from this simulation are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fig4}.
The controller first applied input briefly in a slight desynchronizing region of the PRC, then paused for the remainder of the first negative PRC region due to the likelihood of further desynchronizing the population.
Once the population PDF returned to a region of negative PRC and a negative first derivative of the PRC the controller resumed input driving the population to its $6$h phase delay and restoring full synchrony.
Strikingly, changing the time of input resulted in a slight increase in the synchrony of the population in comparison to its original state, evidenced by an increase in the synchrony index.
Visually, this is evident from the clear alignment of individual oscillators within the population (plotted in gray) in comparison to the dispersion in phase evident in Fig.~\ref{fig:fig3} where synchrony was ignored.


\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conc}}
We have presented a modification of nonlinear MPC for phase manipulation of circadian oscillator populations, in which a PDF of phase is used in solving the finite horizon optimal control problem, allowing mean phase and population synchrony to be regulated simultaneously.
For many PRCs that have been calculated, there exists a region where the PRC or first derivative of the PRC is zero \cite{Dunlap2004}, it is therefore possible to manipulate phase and synchrony independently for a population of circadian oscillators through a single control input.
In reality, the ability to target these regions is limited by precision of the measurements of the PRC and population phase PDF.

One significant challenge in implementing this control algorithm \textit{in vitro} or \textit{in vivo} is the construction of an observer with sufficient accuracy to accurately reconstruct the phase PDF.
Current methods of assessing the phase of circadian oscillators relies on either noisy single-cell bioluminescent markers \textit{in vitro} or system level metrics \textit{in vivo} such as melatonin, activity, or body temperature.
However, even a simplistic assumption such as a wrapped normal PDF with an arbitrary estimate of standard deviation of phase could help avoid delivering control inputs where the slope of the PRC is expected to be positive, and thus help avoid desynchrony.
In this case, a long predictive horizon would quickly become inaccurate, however, necessitating careful selection of design variables $\tau_u$ and $N_p$.

Another challenge toward implementing such an algorithm is incorporating the as-yet uncharacterized pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) for a small-molecule such as KL001.
This could potentially be achieved by including these terms directly in the prediction step of the MPC.
Uncertainty and individual variability in PK/PD measurements may reduce the accuracy of such an approach, however, further study is necessary to determine the extent of this variability, and how these inaccuracies affect controller performance.

It is our hope that these and similar control theoretic methods will inform the discovery of circadian therapies, and enable novel experimental design toward better understanding the dynamics of cellular populations and communication.
